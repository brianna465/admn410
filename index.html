		<h2> <b> History </b> </h2> 
		
Durham House of Pets was founded in 1995 by Ronald Arsenault. Our current owner, Brianna Arsenualt, took over in 2016. 
In the early days of production, Durham house of pets sold only the basics such as: food, accessories, and other pet health related products.
 Over the years we have expanded our range of products extensively and carry almost everything you could ever need for your beloved pet! We have recently
 added reptile products for the many snake lovers in the area. We hope to grow even more in the coming years to provide the best experience to
 our loyal customers.
		
		<h2> <b> Why Use Us </b> </h2>

Durham house of pets was founded by a family of pet lovers dedicated on providing its consumers with all their pet related needs. 
With our 23 years of experience in providing for our customers we have learned what is really important: a wide range of quality products at an 
affordable price. Our employees are extremely passionate about animals and have experience in caring for them. Our original location in downtown Durham is 
convenient for both our in town and out of town customers.
